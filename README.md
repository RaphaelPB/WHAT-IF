## Install

The [Installing and running WHAT IF](https://github.com/RaphaelPB/WHAT-IF/wiki/Installing-and-running-WHAT-IF) contains a step by step guide describing the process, in brief:
* Install the [Anaconda navigator](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator), 
the simpliest way to manage your pyhton packages and versions
* In the anaconda prompt, run:  
`conda config --add channels conda-forge`  
`conda create -n WHATIF_py37 python=3.7.3`  
`conda install -n WHATIF_py37 openpyxl xlsxwriter xlrd pyomo=5.6.2 pandas numpy multiprocess ipopt glpk`  
`conda activate WHATIF_py37`  

* Recommended solvers are ipopt (open-source, non-linear), cplex (free for academics, linear) 
* WHAT-IF is now only released with Python 3.7
